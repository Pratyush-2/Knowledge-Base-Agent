The current agent implements a fully functional RAG pipeline using the SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2') embedding model and FAISS for similarity-based chunk retrieval. The retrieved chunks are then passed to Mistral-7B-Instruct for structured answer generation. This makes the system scalable, efficient, and enterprise-ready.
